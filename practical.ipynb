Important applications are image retrieval - searching through an image dataset to obtain (or retrieve) those images with particular visual content, and image annotation - adding tags to images if they contain particular object categories.\n",

    "The goal of this session is to get basic practical experience with classification. It includes: (i) training a visual classifier for five different image classes (airplanes, motorbikes, people, horses and cars); (ii) assessing the performance of the classifier by computing a precision-recall curve; (iii) training set and testing set augmentation; and (iv) obtaining training data for new classifiers using Bing image search and using the classifiers to retrieve images from a dataset.\n",

For the same reason, they are a natural representation to use in learning an image classifier.\n",
